Added examples for epipolar on unit sphere
epipiolar_unit_sphere.m:      generic utilities (triangulation, essential, 8pt)
test_epipiolar_unit_sphere.m  test functions

To use:
$> octave-cli
octave> pkg load statistics
octave> source "test_epipolar_unit_sphere.m"

1. generate a transform
octave> X=generateTransform();

2. test point triangulation
octave> X=testTriangulatePoints(X, 10);

This generates 10 points, projects them, in the origin and in a
camera in X, and from the projections computes the positions
of the points in the world

3. testing essential

octave> X=testEssential(X, 100);

This generates 100 points, projects w.r.t origin and X,
and from the projections recovers the essential matrix
using the overloaded 8 pt alg.

4. test_transform

octave> X=testTransform(X, 100, 0.001);
This makes the same as above, but extracts the transform
from the computes essential
Beware that noise_level is on the unit sphere, so it should be
small to be meaningful
